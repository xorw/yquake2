- allow_download_maps: Allow downloading maps from the server.
- allow_download_models: Allow downloading models from the server.
- allow_download_players: Allow downloading player models from the server.

- bob_roll:
- bob_up:
- cddir: Directory where the CD can be found if the game is only partially installed to the harddrive.
- cfg_unbindall: If set an 'unbind' command is added to the config file written by Quake II.
- cheats: Allow cheats in multiplayer mode.
- cin_force43: Force videos to be displayed in 4:3, e.g. without distortions.
- cl_anglespeedkey: Offset multiplied onto the network frame time when predicting movement angles. 
- cl_async: If enabled the client is asynchronous, the render framerate is independent from the network framerate.
- cl_blend: If enabled the screen is blended when the player takes damage or wears powerups.
- cl_drawfps: Shows the framecounter. Please note that the framecouter is rather inaccurate.
- cl_entities: Draw entities.
- cl_footsteps: Foodstep noises while walking and running.
- cl_forwardspeed: Player forward and backward movement speed.
- cl_gun: Decides weather the gun is drawn. 1 -> Draw the gun if the FOV is >90 ; 2 -> Always draw the gun.
- cl_lights: If enabled dynamic lights are rendered.
- cl_maxfps: Sets the network framerate. If cl_async is 0 the renderer framerate is capped at cl_maxfps.
- cl_nodelta: Don't delta compress movement commands send to the server.
- cl_noskins: Don't draw individual skins, use the default skin instead.
- cl_particles: If enabled particles are rendered.
- cl_pitchspeed:
- cl_predict: Enables or disabled movement predictions.
- cl_run: If enabled the player is alwas running.
- cl_showmiss: Prints an error message in case the movement prediction failed.
- cl_shownet: Print debug output regarding network package processing.
- cl_sidespeed: Player strafing / sideward movement speed.
- cl_stats: Print internal client statistics, like the number of entities.
- cl_testblend: Test blendig code by applying some artificial blends.
- cl_testentities: Draw some entities for testing purposes.
- cl_testlights: Draws 32 colored dynamic lights in front of the player. For testing purposes.
- cl_testparticles: Draws some partice for testing purposes.
- cl_timeout: Timeout for network connections. In seconds.
- cl_upspeed: Specifies the speed of the up and down movement when keyboard look is used.
- cl_vwep: Use the same weapon model on all multiplayer models.
- cl_yawspeed: Specifies the speed of the left and right movement when keyboard look is used.
- con_notifytime: Specifies how long console messages are drawn. In seconds.
- coop: If set to 1 the game is in coop mode.
- crosshair: The crosshair to use.
- crosshair_scale: Scale factor of the crosshair.
- deathmatch: If set to 1 the game is in deathmatch mode.
- debuggraph: Draws a graph with some debug informations at the bottom of the screen.
- dedicated: If set to 1 the game is in dedicated server mode.
- developer: If set to 1 the game is in developer mode, e.g. some debugcode is enabled and debug messages are printed.
- dmflags: Deathmatch flags, also used for coop. This is a 32 bit long bit mask.
- exponential_speedup: If enabled the mouse becomes faster the longer it's moved.
- filterban: If set to 1 IP addresses on the filtered list are banned from the server. If set to 0 they're allowed.
- fixedtime: Fixes the client timing to 1 millisecond. This is for debug purposes.
- flood_msgs:
- flood_persecond:
- flood_waitdelay:
- fov: Sets the fiel of view. Should be set to 90 when 'horplus' is set to 1.
- fraglimit: The fraglimit.
- freelook: If set to 1 the mouse look is free, e.g. the player uses the mouse to turn around.
- fs_debug: File system debug output.
